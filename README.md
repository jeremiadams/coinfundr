# Coinfundr | A web3 crowdfunding platform.

## Project Description
Coinfundr is a web3 crowdfunding platform. Coinfundr provides individuals and charity organisations a seamless means of sending and recieving donations instantly.

Cryptocurrency donations are on the rise and charities are increasingly equipping themselves to recieve such donations. Coinfundr provides a platform for such individuals and charities to fundraise easily. Cryptocurrency transactions are less restricted than conventional methods and such opens the way for multiple users to easily leverage this techonolgy to make like better. Coinfundr helps with that.

Coinfundr aims to implement a concept we call 'proof of charity'. What this means is users who decide to donate to charities are given a free NFT. These NFTs can later on be used as an authentication means to unlock discounts and promos on other platforms (this increases the incentive to give to such charities).

Coinfundr runs on the polygon network.
